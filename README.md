1. **Map Transformation:**
- Q: Given an array of integers, use the `map` method to square each element and return a new array with the squared values.

2. **Filter and Map Combination:**
- Q: Take an array of strings, filter out the ones with a length less than 5, and then capitalize the remaining strings using the `map` method.

3. **Sorting Objects:**
- Q: Given an array of objects with a 'price' property, use the `sort` method to arrange them in descending order based on their prices.

4. **Reduce for Aggregation:**
- Q: Use the `reduce` method to find the total sum of all even numbers in an array of integers.

5. **Find and Modify:**
- Q: Given an array of objects with 'id' properties, use the `find` method to locate an object with a specific 'id' and update its 'status' property to 'completed'.

6. **Chaining Methods:**
- Q: Create a chain of array methods to find the average of all positive numbers in an array of mixed integers and return the result rounded to two decimal places.

7. **Conditional Filtering:**
- Q: Implement a function that takes an array of objects with 'age' properties and returns an array of those who are adults (age 18 and above) using the `filter` method.

8. **Advanced Sorting:**
- Q: Sort an array of strings based on their lengths in ascending order. If two strings have the same length, maintain their relative order in the sorted array.

9. **Nested Array Operations:**
- Q: Given an array of arrays containing numbers, use a combination of array methods to flatten the structure and then calculate the sum of all the numbers.

10. **Error Handling with Find:**
- Q: Modify the `find` method to handle the scenario where the desired element is not found, returning a custom default object instead.

11. **Map Method:**
- Q: How does the `map` method work in JavaScript, and can you provide an example of when you might use it to manipulate an array of objects?

12. **Filter Method:**
- Q: Explain the purpose of the `filter` method. Provide an example where you use `filter` to extract elements from an array based on a specific condition.

13. **Sort Method:**
- Q: Discuss the default behavior of the `sort` method for strings and numbers. How would you use a custom comparison function to sort an array of objects by a specific property?

14. **Reduce Method:**
- Q: Describe the purpose of the `reduce` method and provide an example where you use it to compute a single value from an array of numbers.

15. **Find Method:**
- Q: How does the `find` method differ from `filter`? Give an example of a scenario where using `find` is more appropriate than `filter`.

16. **Combining Methods:**
- Q: Create a chain of array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.) to transform an array of strings into a single concatenated string with a specific condition.

17. **Callback Functions:**
- Q: Explain the concept of callback functions in the context of array methods. Provide an example of using a callback function with the `map` method.

18. **Error Handling:**
- Q: How would you handle potential errors when using array methods like `find` or `reduce`? Provide an example of error handling in such a scenario.

19. **Immutable Operations:**
- Q: Discuss the importance of immutability when working with array methods. Demonstrate how you would perform immutable operations using methods like `map` or `filter`.

20. **Performance Considerations:**
- Q: Compare the performance implications of using `map` versus `forEach`. In what scenarios would you prefer one over the other, and why?
